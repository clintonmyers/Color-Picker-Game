# Color-Picker-Game
A fun game to help you learn RGB colors!

Technologies: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES5)

 This game was inspired by other color picker games, but no source code was copied. The aesthetic of a similar game by Colt Steele was the inspiration, and the functionality was increased with additional difficulty.
