# Color-Picker-Game
A fun game to help you learn RGB colors!

 This game was inspired by other color picker games, but no source code was copied. The aesthetic of a similar game by Colt Steele was the inspiration, and the functionality was increased with additional difficulty.
 
 Current Bugs:
 
   Colors disappear when they are not supposed to (divs have both win and lose functions when they should only have one or the other)
   Sometimes the numbers do not display at the top.
   
 Functionality to add:
 
   Make colors fade in and fade out.
